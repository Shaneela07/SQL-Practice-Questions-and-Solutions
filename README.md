# SQL-Practice-Questions-and-Solutions

### Welcome to the SQL Practice Repository! 
This repository is designed for students and professionals who want to refine and advance their SQL skills using Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) for career development.

During my learning journey, I found SQL Practice to be an excellent resourceâ€”educational and user-friendly. However, I noticed that the website doesnâ€™t provide a complete solution book, either on the site or GitHub. Thatâ€™s why I created this repository! Here, youâ€™ll find answers and alternative solutions to all the practice questions.

Key Features:

Database Management Systems (DBMS):
The solutions in this repository are written for MSSQL. Since MSSQL syntax may differ slightly from other DBMS (like PostgreSQL or MySQL), all queries have been customized to align with MSSQL conventions.

Dataset and ER Diagram:

The dataset provided in this repository is the same as the one available on the SQL Practice website. This ensures consistency with the questions on the site. Youâ€™ll also find the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) included here to help you understand the data structure, entities, attributes, and relationships between entities.

Practice.....Practice.....and more Practice.....This is the mantra

Northwind Database Solutions:


SQL Practice recently introduced the Northwind database, and Iâ€™ve added MSSQL-specific solutions for it on a separate page, accessible here. However, I strongly recommend starting with the Hospital database, which offers a wide variety of questions and allows you to practice more functional features.

The Hospital database includes 50 questions organized into three categories:

Easy
Medium
Hard
Letâ€™s Get Started!
With the provided dataset and solutions, this repository makes it easier for you to focus on improving your SQL skills. Whether youâ€™re new to SQL or looking to level up, this is the perfect place to start! ðŸš€
